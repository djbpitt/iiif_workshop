### Overview

Workshop outline: <http://jeffreycwitt.com/IIIFWorkshop/docs/doc1>

#### The problem

Stand-alone, self-contained project-as-website perspective emerges from book culture: to find information, go to the book that contains it. In an Internet context, we bind the presentation to the content. Here are three reasons why that isn’t desirable:

1. Each institution builds a full web stack (silo paradigm): an idiosyncratic database and a view that is tightly bound to the idiosyncratic data store. As with a book, if you want the content, you go to the place (website, like book in library). Insofar as a lot of the functionality is redundant, recreating it on each site leads to ...
2. Un-sustainability. Each project is responsible for all levels of its own stack, which is wasteful, redundant, and un-sustainable. (djb: On the other hand, if you depend on external resources, can’t another content maintainer can break your site without your even being aware of it?)
3. Lack of connectivity, leading to redundancy. Since there is no standardized way to draw simultaneously on disparate resources, projects create their own idiosyncratic versions. People address this by recreating data, which is problems 1 and 2.

#### How IIIF addresses the problem

Per IIIF, the book paradigm is no longer applicable. Data is independent of presentations and therefore can be used in multiple presentations. Presentation viewers can access distributed information across institutions, and data stores can publish their information to be consumed by multiple applications. This is achieved by decoupling data stores from data presentation. 

The separation is achieved by standardizing an API on which presentation services can rely without regard to the specific data store. The data is accessible to anonymous consumers, that is, those who do not need to know about local idiosyncrasies, and the answer to that is *standardization*. The specific standard may be arbitrary; what’s important is the consensus agreement to follow a possibly arbitrary decision.

#### How IIIF separates presentation from data

Two types of image-related data, independent of how it might be presented:

1. *Image metadata*, e.g., resolution, aspect ratio, location on server, file format; also includes the image data itself, that is, the image file
2. *Image presentation data*, about how the image might be presented, rather than about the image itself, e.g., label (what is it a picture of), sequence; information the viewer needs to present the data, which must be independent of the source of the image data file

#### The IIIF image API

Community standard for organizing and exposing metadata. Might expose not only image, but part of image, thumbnail, low-quality image (for which loading on mobile). Show rights, formats, resolution, size, host institutionm, etc. IIIF offers a standardized API for this type of information. (djb: Is it exensible for types of information not anticipated by the core API?) 

Documented in [IIIF Image API](https://iiif.io/api/image/2.1/) (currently version 2.1). The API specifies:

1. URI syntax: property names, order, etc.
2. *info.json* file at a standardized location that provides property: value pairs in a standardized format.

There is no single IIIF image server softwarae. It’s a class; any server that implements the IIIF image API is a IIIF image server. There are many, implemented in different programming languages, and they are interchangeable functionally because the presentation is independent of the specific server. If a better server appears, we can swap without having to change the presentation layer. 

One server is [Cantaloupe](https://cantaloupe-project.github.io/).

#### IIIF presentation metadata API

The viewer might receive tiles of an image (assembled and loaded by the viewer), thumbnails, and other resources. But beyond the image itself, the viewer needs to expose *presentation metadata*, such as title, table of contents, order in which to display images, logo of host institution, etc. The image doesn’t know about its order, i.e., that is presentational information, and not image metadata. The display of the image itself is independent of the display of presentational metadata. 

Documented in [IIIF Presentation API 2.1.1](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1/). Just as the image API returns image metadata in *image.json*, the presentation API returns *manifest.json*. And just as there is no single IIIF image server, there is no single presentation software; anything that understands the presentation API is a IIIF presentation tool. Front-end development moves quickly and ages poorly, so if the front-end viewer is not tied to the data, you can swap in a new viewer when one appears. And with the same viewer, you can choose to present the same information differently for different purposes.

A viewer client can, e.g., aggregate information from different servers running on different hosts and interact with them in a consistent way, e.g., display images side by side.

One viewer is [Mirador](https://projectmirador.org/). 

#### Other IIIF APIs

* Search: viewer-agnositic search for content related to images)
* Authentication: important at institutional level, e.g., for copyright and other restrictions—???

#### The IIIF community

Community standards require buy-in, and the list of influential institutional participants is long and impressive. Interest groups focus on manuscripts, museums, newspapers, 3D (far away), audio and visual (not there yet). 

### Sample use cases

Examples from Jeff’s projects, incorporating distributed image content.

Digital editions aim for transparency, which have been compromised by the demands of the book medium (quote from Sahle). The editor wants to make the steps behind the presentation (e.g., initial and intermediate data stages) accessible.

The old way: collect images from different institutions, store (redundant) local copies. Better: make remote data available, to avoid redundant copies, but that is sustainable only if the API is standardized. Transparency relies on independence of institutional idiosyncrasies.

A critical text may expose a copy text with variants from control texts, and we can make full texts available with highlighted comparisons. Those texts stand on top of a transcription, which may have errors or debatable decisions, so it’s helpful to provide the image underlying the transcription. There may be multiple ones, for different witnesses, and we may want to retrieve just the relevant part of a larger image. For example, we might want to view an image line by line, requesting just the snipped that stands behind a single line of transcription. 

Pre-IIIF, the browser would have to request the entire image and display only part of it (*sprites*), which is inefficient (image may be high-resolution, i.e., large, when it isn’t all needed), but IIIF can request a piece of an image independently, which is small, and transferred quickly. This allows zooming of high-resolution images; it looks as if it is zooming in and out on a high-resolution image, but it's just requesting tiles as needed.

Also the old way: create bookmarks in PDF to find relevant locations. This is redundant, since the metadata is added only to the local copy. IIIF maakes it possible to serve this information with the image. [Fragmentarium ](https://fragmentarium.ms/) provides link to manifest, which can be pasted into any IIIF viewer, and sometimes the data is sparse because that’s all they have. But a user can publish an associated table of contents that declares itself to be associated with the manifest, and the viewer can then pull the images from one location and the metadata from another. Likewise with transcription. More generally, this helps link information from institutional repositories and projects. 

#### Discovery

Discoverability of associated data, such as a remote table of contents, for now is experimental: Mirador plug in for LOD announcements talks to a specialized server at St. Louis University. Discovery more broadly is not yet resolved in LOD; how do I find out whether IIIF resources are available for my needs? Currently I find manuscripts the old-fashioned way and libraries let you know that they have IIIF resources in their own ways, which is still part of the so-called silo problem. There’s a Discovery Working Group looking into standardizing aggregation, but none is very robust now. There are plans for a registry where developers can announce resources and changes to resources, and aggregators can be built on top of that; removes the single point of failure. 

### Working with images on a IIIF server

Start here: <http://jeffreycwitt.com/IIIFWorkshop/docs/doc2>

Follow instructions to download (follow secondary link to installation instructions; Windows needs a different command, and also needs an unclear adjustment to the default Java heap allocation) and customize configuration parameter values, which launches Cantaloupe on port 8182. If you can’t install Cantaloupe (because you’re on Windows), use the images on the Archive site.

Log into admin with userid admin and password yolo. Tell it that the path prefix for images is `../images/` (n.b.: trailing space) by following Source -> FilesystemSource -> Prefix. With the demo image showing:

* original: <http://127.0.0.1:8182/iiif/2/demo.jpg/full/full/0/default.jpg>
* turn the image upside down: <http://127.0.0.1:8182/iiif/2/demo.jpg/full/full/180/default.jpg>
* turn it 90 degrees to either side: <http://127.0.0.1:8182/iiif/2/demo.jpg/full/full/90/default.jpg>, http://127.0.0.1:8182/iiif/2/demo.jpg/full/full/270/default.jpg>
* request a thumbnail: <http://127.0.0.1:8182/iiif/2/demo.jpg/full/120,/0/default.jpg>
* request a bitonal copy: <http://127.0.0.1:8182/iiif/2/demo.jpg/full/full/0/bitonal.jpg>
* request a region of the image: <http://127.0.0.1:8182/iiif/2/demo.jpg/200,200,800,700/full/0/default.jpg>

Parameters, then, are, in order:

1. fileid
2. region  (x, y, width, height; x and y are upper left corner)
3. size (width, height;  alternatively, accepts percentages [see API for syntax])
4. rotation
5. {quality}.jpg (e.g., default, color, gray [not grey, which raises an. error], bitonal)
6. default.{format} (e.g., jpg, png; the default can be specified on the server)

Explore parameters at <https://www.learniiif.org/image-api/playground>.

<http://127.0.0.1:8182/iiif/2/demo.jpg/info.json> shows precached scales (fastest return) and recommmended tile widths. The server makes this information available to the viewer; it’s up to the viewer to decide which to expose to the user. The server can be configured to support (or not) specific parameters and values.

View your own image in a IIIF image viewer using <http://mejackreed.github.io/Leaflet-IIIF/examples/?url=http://127.0.0.1:8182/iiif/2/demo.jpg/info.json>, which accepts a local URL. Clicking on the + and - accesses cached scales, looks like zooming, but just requests needed tiles.

### Learning the IIIF presentation API

#### Overview

Start at <http://jeffreycwitt.com/IIIFWorkshop/docs/doc3>.

Image what your image gallery might look like, either by drawing or creating *index.html* as a home page and deciding what it should contain. You might create subsidiary pages like *image1.html*, *image2.html*, etc., each of which would display a particular image.

What sort of information would we need to provide for each image? One is title, that is, each image would have a title instance. Another might be date created, but that leaves the order of presentation up to the user. If I code the order of images into my *index.html*, that’s hard-coded, and doesn’t let the user specify another order. The image display could improve the user experience by giving the user control over the rendering properties. We might want to link to next and previous, using sequence information. Collection metadata, that is, that the image is a member of a particular grouping, which should be accessible from the individual image. We can expose *reasons of interest* with their own labels. Note of this is necessarily enough; repositories need to communicate available presentation metadata to a viewer. The resource that performs this communication is *manifest.json*.

#### The manifest

The manifest instantiates a data object model. It may contain one or more sequences, which makes it possible to display images in multiple orders,  under control of the viewer. A sequence contains canvases, one per grouping within the sequence. A canvas hosts annotations and, below that, content.

Why canvas? The canvas is needed because an object may have multiple images, e.g., multispectral imaging, or different raw images of the same object. If we were to associate metadata annotations with the image, we’d lose that if we changed images. The object being described is not the image, but the object the image represents. One use is when different institutions own parts of the same original page. The original page is the canvas level, and it can refer to the images of the parts.

A good place to make a manifest is in the [Bodleian manifest editor](https://iiif.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/manifest-editor/). Create a new canvas and then add an image into a sequence in the canvas under canvas metadata. The manifest takes the *info.json* URI (e.g., *http://127.0.0.1:8182/iiif/2/demo.jpg/info.json*), since that contains information needed for the manifest.

The state is saved in the browser, and can be downloaded with Save manifest. Create a directory called *manifest* and save the file as *manifest.json*. More efficient is the Ruby script available from a link at <http://jeffreycwitt.com/IIIFWorkshop/docs/doc3>. Change the pointer to the image directory, run it, and move the manifest into the *manifests* subdirectory. Unless the project is running inside a web server, though, the manifest won’t be available, so do the following:

1. Go to https://gist.github.com
1. Paste in the manifest.json file and create a file called manifest.json.
1. Go to a raw view and copy the URI.
1. Running Mirador locally, click on the plus sign and paste the URL for the gist into the box to add a resource.

Pointers in the manifest reference localhost as the client.

### Creating annotations

Start here: <http://jeffreycwitt.com/IIIFWorkshop/docs/doc4>

Annotations are part of the image experience, and are also governed by the IIIF presentation API. We attach annotations to the canvas, not to the image. If we attach an annotation to particular coordinates, we need the coordinates (this will break if multiple images associated with a canvas have different aspect ratios). We also need the annotation content. 

We can attach a resource called an *annotation store* to a Mirador instance. The annotation store is a database; you can create the annotation inside Mirador and store it there. This only works in a specific Mirador instance, though; if you move to a difference Mirador instance, the annotations won’t be there. To address that limitation, we can create a static annotation list and attach it to the canvas within the manifest. See the examples of both of these approaches at <http://jeffreycwitt.com/IIIFWorkshop/docs/doc4>.
